1. For this week I accomplished 2 out of the 3 goals that I have set for this week but I worked on a little extra stuff on the side.
- I was able to finish the animation and upload it into the main menu of my app the only problem is that because it's a gif it runs on the loop. But I think I actually like it that way.
- I did do some research into the D5 document and looked at the types of user testing that I want to complete; end-to-end testing and a cognitive walkthrough.
- I still have yet to finish the search filter because it's taken me a bit to figure out. The Alias of the restaurant is the name of the restaurant but also can be used for the subsection of the categories. I tried doing some reseach on how I could get it to work but I am not sure. (Down below I put an image with the code from Yelp, and my code for filters to try and see if I could get some help)

2. The biggest challenge that I faced this week was trying to get the animation to be a transparent background animation. But Thunkables animations are linked from Lottiefiles.com and they convert your gif from a json file into an animation but they don't leave the transparent background. So instead I uploaded the gif to my screen and an image box and now it runs on a loop but I am fine with it because it adds more uniqueness. Another problem that I have had was trying to get the filters section to work.

3. I hope to use this week to work really hard on my app and get my problem with the search filter solved.
- I am going to try and finish up implementing the search filter into my app to be one step closer to finishing my app. Hopefully this will only take a couple of days when I find the time to look into it more and figure out how to display the subcategories.
- Then I want to work on creating a QR Code scanner for my app for some of the online menus that restaurants off so users won't have to download a separate app. This should only take a couple of hours because thunkable is pretty easy to work with the camera function. I already tested it out and was able to build a image recognizer app for fun.
- I also hope to get the wheel to work more with the choosing of the restaurant. Which means I will have the app be able to display what color the wheel landed on, what restaurant was selected from landing on that color, and hopefully the type of restaurant that was chosen. Depending on how long item one will take, it'll be reflected here. If I can't get the filters to work, then I will have the wheel screen only display the color it landed on and the restaurant selected because of it (which would only take a couple of hours).
