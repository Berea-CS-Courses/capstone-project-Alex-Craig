1. - This week I have finished up research with my APIs and have chosen the Yelp API. After that I watched some Youtube Videos and discovered a block code website much like AppInventor. 
- After that I was able to create a basic prototype to show off in class. I created two pages, the menu page with a distance slider and the results page which is abloe to display the name of the restaurant, the phone number,  a picture of the restaurant, a reroll button and a more info button.

2. The biggest challenge I faced was learning the new website. Although it is very similar to AppInventor, it still has new  features that I wasn't sure how worked. I used a lot of the websites tutorials to figue out which each thing did.

3. In the following week I plan to rework the design of the app to move the distance slider to a different page of the app and then add more filters (type and price) for the restaurant selcetion. I need to do some research about implementing the wheel. I already have the picture created for the wheel just need it to spin. Finally I want to add a get directions button rather than the user grabbing the location from the yelp website.
