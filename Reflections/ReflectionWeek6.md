1. For this final week I worked super hard to finish everything that I could to be ready for the presentations.
- I was able to finish getting the QR Code Sacanner to work and make a clickable link when it is clicked in the app and will take you to a new page.
- I finished getting the color wheel to work and display the right color and now it will actually display the color of the text to be the same as the color of the wheel to truly reflect what it lands on even more.
- I worked on making my app look better so I have taken out the color sliders and instead used photoshop to create a rainbow gradient background that is appealling.
- I also was able to finish all 3 of my cognitive walkthroughs and the relflections for each and submitted those into github.
- I have good news and bad news. Bad news is that I still haven't gotten the search filter to work but the good news it when I replaced the text at the end that displays the restaurant name it was actually able to show the type of restaurant it is so there's a small problem with getting the inputs and output somewhere.

2. The biggest challenge that I faced this week was trying to get everything done in time. I created all my issues for any known bugs that I have and I spent a lot of time this weekend trying to complete them. It was just a lot of work and I wanted to complete them before submitting this reflection because this is the last one.

3. I hope to use this week to work really hard on my app and trying to finish any left over issues by tuesday night/wednesday morning. 
- I am going to try and get help in implementing the search filter and if it doesn;t work I will have to drop it and look into it at a later date. Even though I will be finished with the class I will not be finished with the app as a lot of my friend are really interest in my app.
- Then I want to work finishing my testing by working on my end to end testing as soon as possiblee. So If I can't get my search filter done I'll drop it and work on the end to end teasting instead.
- Finally I hope to finish everything and put it all together for my D5 and my presentation.
