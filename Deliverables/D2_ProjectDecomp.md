# Deliverable 2 - Project Decomposition

**Name: Alex Craig**  

**Components**
- Take in the users location
- Use Google Places API to display restaurants based on the location of the users input.
- Filter the restaurants by availability, distance, price range, and food type (possibly web scraping).
- Display the list of restaurants to allow the user to select certain restaurants.
- Spin the wheel and choose a random restaurant.
- Allow the user to spin again if needed.
- Get directions for chosen restaurant.

**Understanding the components**
- By writing out my components in a list in order based on what I want the app to do seems a lot easier than I first assumed and was worried about. When I see this list I realize that the previous step is required for the next step. Now I have a timeline and backbone of what I need to get done I think I will be able to implement these features easier.

**Breaking up components**
- My components are pretty much broken up into the bits and pieces that I need to work on. However I could break up the filtering process into different steps but I think the Google Places API will already display the distance, price range, etc.

**Prioritize**
- Think of app names
- Learn Google Places API (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oG2Q2GMOBE&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers)
- Design a logo (Needed for Google Places)
- Everything else is in the order needed from the components
- Putting everything together into an app and/or website.
