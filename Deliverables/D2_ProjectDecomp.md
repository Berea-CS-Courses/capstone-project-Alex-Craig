# Deliverable 2 - Project Decomposition

**Name: Alex Craig**  

**Components**
- Take in the users location
- Use Google Places API to display restaurants based on the location of the users input.
- Filter the restaurants by availability, distance, price range, and food type (possibly web scraping).
- Display the list of restaurants to allow the user to select certain restaurants.
- Spin the wheel and choose a random restaurant.
- Allow the user to spin again if needed.
- Get directions for chosen restaurant.

**Understanding the components**
- By writing out my components in a list in order based on what I want the app to do seems a lot easier than I first assumed and was worried about. When I see this list I realize that the previous step is required for the next step. Now I have a timeline and backbone of what I need to get done I think I will be able to implement these features easier.

**Breaking up components**
- My components are pretty much broken up into the bits and pieces that I need to work on. However I could break up the filtering process into different steps but I think the Google Places API will already display the distance, price range, etc.

**Prioritize**
- Think of app names (Restaurant Roulette - Ezra S.)
- Learn Google Places API (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oG2Q2GMOBE&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers)
- Design a logo (Needed for Google Places)
- Everything else is in the order needed from the components
- Putting everything together into an app and/or website.

**Notes**
- I actually figured out how to create this app with coding from Apple's IOS Shortcuts. The only problem with this is that if I do this my app will be limited to IOS devices only.
- Also as of Thursday (3/4/21) I was able to learn enough html code to create a map that displays a given location (from the code) and marks restaurants in a 5 mi radius (set in code). When the marker is left clicked it displays the restaurant name, if a new location on the map is right clicked it clears the previous markers and displays the new markers.
- However for the time being there is a small problem with the filter as Google separates fast food from non fast food resaurants and won't display everything.
