Overview:

So the project that I have settled on completing is my Food Randomizer App that will try and randomize a food location based off the information given (covered in Concepts). With this app I hope to help friend groups eliminate the time it takes to choose somewhere to go and allows for more time spent hanging out rather than just searching. If enough time is available I also hope to add activities such as movies, mini golf, aracades, bowling, etc. to create an Activity Randomizer.

Concepts:

The main concept is to build more onto a basic wheel app that allows you to input the things you want to do inside and instead allows the app to do it for you, and gives you the information of the restaurant included. I hope to use the Google Places API and Angular CLI to create a website and/or app. My project will take in information such as the urgency/waiting time, how much you are willing to spend, measurements (km/mi), distance, displays the ratings and hours of the restaurant, and a possible option for a reroll as its major features. I also plan to add a search option that allows you to search based off of type of food to accomodate for allergies and dietary restrictions, but most restaurants already have alternative options so this might be dropped.
