## Instructions

1. a. Covid tracing and rating app: tracks stores restaurants and other places near you and allows users to rate a place based on how they be handled covid. (Get it working with the business,covid performance reviews, use other app, create a heat map.)
b. Activity tinder: when hanging with friends or on a date based on what you want to do creates a "tinder experience" by having the people who want to do the activity such as food options or extra curricular (make anonymous, Google maps API to find activities in the area, recommendations,likes and dislikes, based off types of restaurants)

c. App that in a restaurant where you can see the restaurant, input your table number and make the order, and contact their waiter through their phone (Texas Roadhouse, contact trace instead of names)

d. Multiple workplace app that takes all of the programs and puts them into one app, calendar, notes, Excel etc.

e. Music queue nfc chip coasters that allows anyone at a party to add a song to the queue using a coaster without having to ask the host to hand them their phone.

2. a. Reduce Covid spreading and allowing users to be their own health inspectors. The target users could be anyone that wants to flatten the curve I know people who really don't care about Covid and that's on them. Web and mobile app. I personally give this a 4.
b. Try to help reduce waiting time in friends groups because people aren't sure what they want to do. The target audience would probably be for the younger people (16-28) but doesn't exclude anyone older that still hangs out. Web and mobile app. I give this a 4.5.

c. Similar to a this can reduce limit the interaction between the user and the waitress but isn't better than option a. Target audience is for people that still want to go out to eat during the pandemic. Mobile App. I give this a rating of 3.5.

d. For convenience sake this takes all of the work apps and puts them into one app that allows the users to switch between them more easily. Target audience would be anyone ages 16 and up (to include anyone in school, college, or an office job). Mobile and Web (However it would be similar to having multiple tabs open) I give this a rating of 3.

e. To help people at a party add songs to queue and providing a coaster while doing so. Target audience of ages 18-28. Mobile app/ physical coaster. I give this a rating of 5.

3. My prefered idea is the NFC music coasters but a close second is the activity tinder app. I am fine with doing either as they are my favorites. I prefer these two because I go out a lot with friends (2 of which are roommates) so these would benefit us.
