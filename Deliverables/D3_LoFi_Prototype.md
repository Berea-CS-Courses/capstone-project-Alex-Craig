**Reflection**
- I used previous sketch from D1/D2 and edited them around the tiny bit of code that I have finished. I had to scrap a small portion of my project because of the limitations of the shortcuts app. Instead of loading a wheel with the random options the app will now load a random GIF based off the random restaurant type.
- It informed more about what I want to do with my project and how it's changing because originally I wanted to app to be a multi-user based app but based off my limit of knowledge, I decided to make it single user (driver) take in the passengers verbal requests and add them to the random list.
- If I miss something in my user flow chart what's the best way to add it if the way it is represented in the code is something the happens behind the scenes?
- I feel confident enough to where I have actually started a little bit and used it for this Deliverable. 

**Updates**
Since I am creating the app from a different application that's not the Shortcuts App, I went and created a new flowchart and paper sketch of what I want my app to embody.
