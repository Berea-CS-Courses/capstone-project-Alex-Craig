**Proof of Concept**
- 

**Documentation**
- IOS Devices and the Shortcuts app are required to run my proof of concept, additionally the app need access to calls, location, notifications, and opening shortcuts for the app to work completely.
- I finally got the link to work so others with IOS devices and the shortcut app can test my app. To begin go to this link https://bit.ly/3cky7PO and click "Add Shortcut" this will add the Restaurant Roulette to your shortcut app and will show you the completed code that I have. Then by clicking on 3 dots in the box will allow you to go into the code and change the list of restaurant types to your liking. Then you can in the code, scroll until you find Allow Access for calls, location, notifications, and opening shortcuts to have the code run more smooth without asking questions.
- This app takes in the users location, and food type list and randomly generates a restaurant nearby. Then allows the user to choose whether they want to call, visit the website, get directions or roll again. After they have chosen a previous option it will then ask the user again what they would like to do to confirm if they would still like to go there. (Incase they view the website and they don't like what they have to offer.)
- Everything that I have in the app is what I have created, the only thing that isn't mine is the GIFs that come from GIPHY that are displayed in the restaurant choice screen.
